We report on ["Emile"](https://github.com/BildungBegabung/emile), a collaborative writing class on Education and Democracy we taught at [Deutschen Sch√ºlerAkademie](https://www.deutsche-schuelerakademie.de), a summer school program for gifted students by Bildung & Begabung GmbH.

To enable all 16 students to work together on *one* and receive intensive intensive feedback, we used tools and conventions from (open source) software development, including the general-purpose editor [Atom](https://atom.io), the source control management [Git](http://git-scm.com) and commercial git-hoster and social network [Github](https://github.com).
The physical instruction during the two-week seminar was complemented by a comprehensive learning environment on Github, including reading questions and peer review.

These tools required intensive instruction, but offer substantial benefits past a steep learning curve.
Robust, reproduceable and permissionless collaboration strengthened positive interdependence, individual accountability, promotive interaction, social skills, group processing and deliberative practice.

Writing academic texts as developers write (open source) code allows for more intensive feedback and collaboration than conventional writing assignments.
In addition, this setup increases students IT skills, allows for public, iterative writing and invites reflections on human cooperation and technology-enabled opportunities.

We cautiously recommend these tools for academic teaching, when the necessary learning curve can be mastered and offer suggestions for implementation.
